<h2>Don't Fear The Static Site Generator</h2>
<p>I’ve recently migrated my site to Jekyll from using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I had this strange aversion towards using a static site generator from the beginning, but that probably had more to do with not doing much research on them. I assumed that it would be a case of just using a template and doing some modifications a la WordPress, therefore taking all the craftsmanship out of it. Turns out I was wrong.</p>

<p>Switching to a static site generator only took a morning of work. Creating this blog section only took an hour. I initially wanted to use an iframe and just plop my WordPress blog here, but I’ve been informed that this isn’t the best move from an SEO standpoint.</p>
