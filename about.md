Since a young age, I’ve always been in awe of people that knew how to program. At the tender age of eleven I bought a book on Visual Basic and tried to teach myself in its uses, but being a child with a short attention span my attempts were in vain. Since then, I’ve dabbled with programming at various points through the years.

I began to take this pursuit seriously about a  year and a half ago, and found this interest re-affirmed when I decided to give <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">CS50</a> a try. It was challenging, my programs wouldn't compile half the time, but by the end of it I'd developed the self-efficacy that made me believe I had the chance to work as a developer full-time.

I have a tendency to dabble with various languages, but find that my main strength comes in the use of pure JavaScript. I am familiar with several frameworks on top of this (React, NodeJS etc.).

I realise that to be a proficient developer, in addition to developing a core expertise in a specific area, you must be versatile and commit to life-long learning. I take this pursuit seriously, and try to stay versed in all the latest trends.
