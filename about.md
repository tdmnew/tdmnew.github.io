<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>For the majority of my adult life I've held down jobs in administration, with a few exceptions here and there. During that time, I often made a few good attempts at learning programming, but would often become overwhelmed when I learned of the scope of this discipline. When I came to accept I couldn't learn everything, the burden suddenly eased and I started to enjoy myself. </p> 
<p>I began to take this pursuit seriously about a  year and a half ago, and found this interest re-affirmed when I decided to give <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">CS50</a> a try. It was challenging, my programs wouldn't compile half the time, but by the end of it I'd developed the self-efficacy that made me believe I had the chance to work as a developer full-time. </p>
<p>I have a tendency to dabble with various languages, but find that my main strength comes in the use of pure JavaScript. I have knowledge in several frameworks, but find I am best suited to React. I also have a fair understanding of Node JS, including the use of Express for routing, as well as an understanding of MongoDB.</p> 
<p>I realise that to be a proficient developer, in addition to developing a core expertise in a specific area, you must be versatile and commit to life-long learning. I take this pursuit seriously, and try to stay versed in all the latest trends.</p>
