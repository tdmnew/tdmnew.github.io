title: Using The Oculus Go As a Monitor Replacement

Having just picked up an Oculus Go a few days ago I wanted to share my thoughts. I know people have mixed feeling about using it as a monitor replacement, and it's really not my intention to try and convert anybody to my way of doing things here, but I just wanted share some of the positive experiences I've had when working with the Oculus Go and Virtual Desktop.

I previously tried to use the Rift for productivity, but I just found that the resolution was too low for text to be legible. The 1440p upgrade of the Go finally makes this viable in my eyes - although it is still effectively a 720p screen being projected in virtual space. It also helps that the facial interface is much more comfortable, as well. I've actually spent significant periods for the past three days in Virtual Desktop, and despite some discomfort to my cheeks and forehead from prolonged use, I've found that I'm able to everything I could do with a conventional monitor.

I spend a few hours a day programming, and an hour a day studying at the open university. I use the pomodoro technique ensuring I spend 25 minutes working and have a 5 minute break. I've found that I am completely immersed in my work this way, and have actually been far more productive than I would have been had I used a conventional monitor. I find that I can be distracted by my surroundings, whereas I achieve more 'flow' states when using the HMD. Time flies a lot quicker, too.

Some of my current university work involves doing binary calculations, and I've taken to just opening up mspaint as a virtual whiteboard and using the pointer device that comes with the Go to write my working-out that way. Considering how accurate the pointer is, this has been a surprisingly intuitive way of writing things out.

I've noticed that these distraction-free periods actually appear to be making me more 'present' when I'm outside of the headset. I find that I'm more invested in whatever activity I'm doing. I generally find that I'm a little calmer, too.

It's still not all there. I think people have a valid point when they say they don't like the idea of using a HMD as a desktop replacement. The optics of the Go are fantastic, but they still produce some god-rays, and some colours appear to be washed out (Which is why I still cannot recommend it for colour-sensitive work). There's the obvious issue that your surroundings are completely obscured which may lead to accidents when taking a drink (Which is why I'm looking forward to the next generation headsets having a pass-through camera mode as standard).

Using the hole in the nose-bridge is crucial to still being able to use the keyboard- regardless how good a touch-typist you are. These issues could be alleviated by having a virtual representation of the keyboard, with keystrokes being highlighted in real-time. Oculus Dash had this, and I found this to be essential to typing. It also helps when your using some key combination (Say, you hold down the Shift and Tab keys and use the pointer to press the '@' key). I've passed these suggestions on to the developer.



Virtual Desktop is a tremendous piece of software, and even on my 2.4Ghz connection I'm capable of using my PC with very little perceivable latency. I admire what ImmerseVR is trying to do, and appreciate Big Screen Beta, but they don't come close to achieving the same low-latency that Virtual Desktop does. The developer is also fantastic at communicating with his audience, and provides frequent updates to the software as well. It's well deserving of it's Â£7.99 price.

So yeah, so far it's been very positive. Although I will admit this is the honeymoon period.
