<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
This site was my attempt at coming to grips with HTML, CSS and
JavaScript following my introduction having taken the CS50 course at
EDX. I wanted to create a website that made use of transition
animations between pages. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
Unfortunately, for a first attempt, there a lot of redundancy in my
code (As you will see by checking the page source). My hope was that
the code could be easily repurposed into another site just by
changing a few of the images and element names. Maybe I&rsquo;ll
clean up the code a little and allow it to be repurposed &ndash;
although it&rsquo;s more likely I&rsquo;ll get bored and make a new
site once I find a new framework to play with!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><b>Coming Soon:
Habit Tracker using Node.js or Flask:</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
This is my intended project for the final part of the CS50 course,
which is a brilliant course for anyone that&rsquo;s interested &ndash;
it&rsquo;s really given me much more confidence as a fledgling
developer. I feel that developing my site was a nice primer for
front-end development (Albeit there are a few aspects that are a
little...wanting), but this next project will be a good opportunity
to get my hands dirty with some of the server-site aspects of web
development.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
The application will act much like what you&rsquo;d find on the
Android or Apple store, but with a few of its own little quirks
thrown in. Habit formation/removal is something very near and dear to
me. I was actually borderline obese and completely sedentary a couple
of years ago, but having engrained some positive habits into my
day-to-day life I&rsquo;m much more self-disciplined now.</p>
