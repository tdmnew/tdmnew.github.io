I'm an aspiring developer from the North East of England with knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node JS), Python and C#. I’m currently studying for a BSc in Computing and IT part-time, while looking for work in this industry.

Coding is a discipline that I find intrinsically satisfying, wherein an entire day can fly by working on a project. This is an industry where I find myself constantly humbled by the work of others, giving me the motivation to continuously improve.

My passion and drive are complimented by a number of soft skills accrued from previous roles. Prior to embarking on a career in development, I spent several years working in the mental health services. Netted from this time are a wealth of interpersonal skills which are sure to be a great fit for any team.

If you’re interested in collaborating on a project, or have any comments on my work, I’d love to hear from you. I can be contacted below:
