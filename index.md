<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>I'm an aspiring developer with knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node JS), Python and C#. I'm looking to work in this field permanently, and am currently studying for a BSc in Computing and IT.</p> 
<p>I've revised this website from a distracting, visually noisy jQuery-backed mess into something that is hopefully a little more streamlined, simple and makes better use of pure JS. You could say this has been something of a UX learning experience.</p>
<p> To gain some experience, for a limited time, I may be able to provide web development services free of charge. This does partly depend on the scope of the project, however. Please send me a message below explaining your needs and I will see how I can help.</p>

<p>Call me a Luddite (Which is pretty interesting, considering software and web development are of particular interest to me), but I'm not on any form of social media. My longest exposure to social media was back in the mid-2000s with Myspace for all of a month. Since then, I mostly stick to email.</p>
<p>I'm well aware of the value of networking when it comes to careers, but I prefer the candidness that would usually come from other forms of communication. There may come a time where it'll be necessary to get with the times and jump on to social media, but for now I'll just stick to email.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I'm pretty good at responding to emails in a timely fashion.</p>

<p>The dilemma of teaching yourself a skill such as programming is that you lack the oversight and feedback required to improve and succeed. I myself have no doubt committed a great many programming faux-pas in recent history.</p>
<p>That's why I want someone to be able to bounce ideas off and learn with. If you have any cool ideas or code that needs to be checked with a second pair of eyes, or wish to provide me with some feedback for my own work, I'd love to speak to you.</p>
<p>I'm going to try and do a better job of listing my projects on GitHub. Feel free to get in contact or share some ideas.</p>
