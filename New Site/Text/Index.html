<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Welcome to my website!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I'm an aspiring
developer with knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the MERN stack
(Mongoose, Express, React, Node JS), Python and C#. I'm looking to
work in this field permanently, and in my free time I am studying
towards a BsC in Computing and Science.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I've revised this
website from a distracting, visually noisy jQuery-backed mess into
something that is hopefully a little more streamlined, simple and
makes better use of pure JS. You could say this has been something of
a UX learning experience. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">To gain some
experience, for a limited time I will be providing web development
services free of charge. This does partly depend on the scope of the
project, however. Please send me a message below explaining your
needs and I will see how I can help.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Call me a Luddite
(Which is pretty interesting, considering software and web
development are of particular interest to me), but I swear off social
media as a whole. My longest exposure to social media was back in the
mid-2000s with Myspace for all of a month. Since then, I mostly stick
to email.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I'm well aware of the
value of networking when it comes to careers, but I prefer the
candidness that would usually come from other forms of communication.
There may come a time where it'll be necessary to get with the times
and jump on to social media, but for now I'll just stick to email.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Fortunately, I'm pretty
good at responding to emails in a timely fashion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Collaboration</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The dilemma of teaching
yourself a skill such as programming is that you lack the oversight
and feedback required to improve and succeed. I myself have no doubt
committed a great many programming faux-pas in recent history.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">That's why I want
someone to be able to bounce ideas off and learn with. If you have
any cool ideas or code that needs to be checked with a second pair of
eyes, or wish to provide me with some feedback for my own work, I'd
love to speak to you.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I'm going to try and do
a better job of listing my projects on GitHub. Feel free to get in
contact or share some ideas.</P>
