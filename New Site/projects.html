          <p>Get It Together was the first full-scale app I ever worked on. This was my final project for  <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">CS50</a>. At its core, it's a habit tracker and a calender, but with a few other features thrown in here and there. </p>
          <p>The project ended up taking much longer than anticipated because I got it in my head that I had to do everything myself (Such as routing) without any pre-built solutions. I ended up meeting several roadblocks because I wasn't nearly versed enough in a particular subject to proceed. Needless to say, I have a deeper understanding of why front-end development and back-end development are categorised as two separate disciplines entirely. </p>
          <p>I followed <a href="https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/">Traversy Media's Udemy Course</a> at the beginning of my project, but eventually decided to go it alone for the rest of the project. I have doubtless committed a few anti-patterns here and there. I found it interesting to see my skills progress as more components were added, in that my code became more readable and made better use of ECMAScript 6 syntactic sugar. </p>
          <p>The project was hardly ambitious, didn't stick to schedule and has some ugly code here and there, but I'm still immensely proud of the work I did. I started the project pretty much clueless with little conceptual understanding of things like state management, and ended it understanding how all of the elements of my application coalesce and developed a more reasoned approach to finding errors and correcting them </p>
          <p>I'm looking to port this to Electron to create a desktop app as I can't find any reliable Node JS hosting for free.</p>
